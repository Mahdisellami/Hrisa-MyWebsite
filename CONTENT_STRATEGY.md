- Enthusiastic about technology
- Humble about achievements

### Language Guidelines

**Do Use**:
- "I built...", "I developed...", "I designed..."
- "Production-ready", "deployed", "live"
- "Solving problems", "addressing challenges"
- "Exploring", "experimenting", "innovating"
- "Open to", "available for", "interested in"

**Avoid**:
- Hyperbole ("revolutionary", "groundbreaking")
