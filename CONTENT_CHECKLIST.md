## 🔧 How to Add Images

### Step 1: Get Your Images Ready
1. Collect all photos from your devices
2. Resize/optimize them (use tools like:
   - **Mac**: Preview (Export → reduce quality to 80%)
   - **Online**: TinyPNG, Squoosh.app
   - **CLI**: ImageMagick, Sharp)
3. Rename them clearly (no spaces, lowercase)

### Step 2: Add to Project
```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd /Users/peng/Documents/mse/private/Hrisa-MyWebsite/hrisa-portfolio/public/images

# Copy your images
# Example:
